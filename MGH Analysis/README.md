# 🏥 MGH Healthcare Dashboard: Patient Encounters, Cost, and Readmission Analysis

Welcome to the **Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Healthcare Dashboard Project**!  
This Excel-based dashboard transforms complex encounter-level data into actionable insights focused on **readmissions**, **cost analysis**, and **operational efficiency**.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The MGH Healthcare Dashboard was created to help hospital stakeholders identify trends and inefficiencies in patient care delivery. The project focuses on:

- **30-day readmissions**  
- **Cost vs. coverage insights**  
- **Length of stay trends**  
- **Encounter types over time**

Designed entirely in **Microsoft Excel**, this project showcases the power of well-structured spreadsheets, pivot tables, timeline slicers, and conditional logic in surfacing healthcare intelligence.

## 🧠 Key Insights

### ✅ Readmission Patterns
- Using Excel logic, we flagged whether a patient had been **readmitted within 30 days** of a prior visit.
- **February consistently showed spikes in readmission cases**, suggesting seasonal or resource-related factors.
- Many readmissions occurred within shorter durations of stay, indicating possible discharge inefficiencies or follow-up gaps.

### 💰 Cost and Payer Coverage
- The **average visit cost** typically ranged between **$2,000 and $4,000**, with variation by encounter type and payer.
- **Insurance covered most procedures**, though a notable portion of cases had **partial or no coverage**, highlighting out-of-pocket patient risks.
- Visuals helped compare **base encounter cost vs. total claim cost** across organizations and years.

### ⏱️ Duration and Encounter Class
- **Majority of encounters lasted 2–5 hours**, with a small percentage extending to longer durations (up to 8+ hours).
- The dashboard categorizes encounter classes (e.g., Emergency, Inpatient, Outpatient) to help understand service demand and operational load.
